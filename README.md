# Call Center Performance Optimization for United Airlines

## Problem Statement
As United Airlines continues to strive toward becoming the best airline in the history of aviation, providing world-class customer service is a key priority. The call center operations play a crucial role in resolving customer issues efficiently. However, challenges remain in improving key performance metrics such as Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST).

The goal of this project is to analyze call center data, identify inefficiencies, and optimize these metrics to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce escalations, and improve overall operational efficiency.

## Background
In the competitive airline industry, efficient customer service is essential for retaining customers and building loyalty. The call center is a critical touchpoint for passengers handling inquiries, complaints, and service requests. Growing demand and service complexity necessitate the optimization of this channel.

### Key Metrics:
- **AHT (Average Handle Time)**: Measures the total time agents spend on a call, from answering to disconnecting.
- **AST (Average Speed to Answer)**: Measures the time customers spend in the queue before their call is answered.

### Formulas:
- **AHT** = Total Handle Time / Total Number of Calls
- **AST** = Total Waiting Time / Total Number of Calls

By optimizing these metrics, the aim is to:
- **Reduce AHT**: Allowing agents to handle more calls while maintaining service quality.
- **Lower AST**: Minimizing customer wait times, enhancing customer experience, and reducing call abandonment rates.

## Solution Approach
1. **Data Analysis**: Identify inefficiencies by analyzing existing call center data.
2. **Root Cause Determination**: Explore the drivers behind long AHT and AST.
3. **Recommendations**: Suggest strategies to streamline processes, balance automation (IVR systems), and agent resources.

## Conclusion
This project will deliver insights into operational inefficiencies in the call center and propose actionable strategies to improve overall customer service performance at United Airlines.
